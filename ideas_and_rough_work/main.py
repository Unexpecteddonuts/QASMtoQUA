# 1. Token: A class representing a token with attributes such as type, value, and position.
# 1. Lexer: This class will take the input QASM code as a string and convert it into a stream of tokens. Each token represents a meaningful unit in the code, such as keywords, identifiers, numbers, 
#    symbols, etc. The lexer will use regular expressions to match the patterns of the tokens.
# 2. Parser: This class will take the stream of tokens generated by the lexer and construct a parse tree according to the grammar rules. The parser will use a parsing technique such as Recursive Descent, 
#    LL(1), or LALR(1) parsing. The parser will also define the actions that need to be performed for each production rule in the grammar.
# 3. SymbolTable: This class will create a symbol table to keep track of the defined variables, registers, and gates in the QASM code. The symbol table will help in resolving names and maintaining consistency 
#    during parsing and semantic analysis.
# 4. SemanticAnalyzer: This class will perform semantic checks on the parsed QASM code to ensure correctness and consistency. This includes checking for variable declarations, type compatibility, and scoping  
#    rules. The semantic analyzer will also generate the equivalent Qua code based on the parsed QASM constructs.
# 5. QuaCodeGenerator: This class will map the QASM gate operations, measurements, and other instructions to their corresponding Qua counterparts. The Qua code generator will generate the final Qua code that 
#    can be executed on a quantum computer.
