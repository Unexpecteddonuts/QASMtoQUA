# Creating a parser to parse QASM code to QUA

## Abstract:
The goal of this project was to take the QASM code provided as an attribute in a JSON file, by the front end, and convert it to QUA code, Qua was the language that the OPX can understand and interpret, this language basically operates at pulse level and generates the individual pulses. This conversion was done with inspiration from how assembly code in classical computers is converted to machine language.
